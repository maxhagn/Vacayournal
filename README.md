## = Vacation + Journal 

In this repository you can find a clone of Instagram and Facebook that I developed in the summer of 2019. The application was written in PHP and JavaScript without frameworks. The goal of the application was to develop a platform independent of Facebook (Meta) on which pictures and posts can be shared with friends. The goal of the development was to further my education in web development and website design.
